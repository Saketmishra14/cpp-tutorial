## Introduction

This C++ tutorial is designed to help beginners and intermediate learners master C++. Each section of the tutorial builds on the previous one, providing practical examples, exercises, and explanations to solidify your understanding of C++.

By the end of this tutorial, you will be able to:
- Write basic C++ programs.
- Understand data types, operators, and control structures.
- Implement object-oriented programming concepts such as classes and inheritance.
- Solve real-world problems using algorithms and data structures.

## Getting Started

To follow along with this tutorial, you'll need:
- A C++ compiler (e.g., GCC, Clang, or MSVC).
- A text editor or IDE (such as Visual Studio Code, Code::Blocks, or CLion).
- Basic knowledge of programming concepts.

## Tutorial Overview

This tutorial is divided into several sections:

1. **Introduction to C++**
   - Overview of C++ and its history.
   - Setting up the development environment.
   
2. **Basic Syntax and Structure**
   - Writing your first C++ program.
   - Understanding `main()` function and basic syntax.

3. **Variables and Data Types**
   - C++ data types (int, float, char, etc.).
   - Declaring variables and using constants.

4. **Control Structures**
   - `if`, `else`, and `switch` statements.
   - Loops: `for`, `while`, `do-while`.

5. **Functions in C++**
   - Defining and calling functions.
   - Function parameters and return types.

6. **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Concepts**
   - Classes and objects.
   - Constructors, destructors, and member functions.
   - Inheritance and polymorphism.

7. **Data Structures and Algorithms**
   - Arrays, Linked Lists, Stacks, and Queues.
   - Sorting and Searching algorithms.

8. **File Handling**
   - Reading from and writing to files.

9. **Advanced Topics**
   - Pointers, dynamic memory allocation, and memory management.
   - Templates and the Standard Template Library (STL).

## Topics Covered

- Basic syntax and structure of C++ programs.
- Variable declarations and data types.
- Control flow: conditions and loops.
- Functions: how to write and use functions.
- Object-Oriented Programming: classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism.
- Data structures like arrays, linked lists, and more.
- File handling and input/output operations.
- Pointers, memory management, and templates.

## Installation

Follow these steps to set up your C++ environment and start the tutorial.

### Requirements:
- A C++ compiler (GCC, Clang, or MSVC).
- A text editor or IDE for coding (e.g., Visual Studio Code, Code::Blocks, or CLion).
- Ensure that you have Git installed if you plan to clone the repository.
